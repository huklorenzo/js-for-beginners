## 💡 Tips for Learning

1. **Start from the beginning**: Even if you know some JavaScript, the exercises build on each other
2. **Try before looking**: Attempt to solve each exercise before checking the solution
3. **Experiment**: Modify the code to see what happens - that's how you learn!
4. **Read errors**: Error messages help you understand what went wrong
5. **Practice regularly**: Coding is a skill that improves with practice

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and layout
- **CSS3**: Styling and animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks or libraries needed
- **Fetch API**: For making HTTP requests
